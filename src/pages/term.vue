        <h1>Terms of Use</h1>

        <p>
            These terms and conditions (“Agreement”) set forth the general terms
            and conditions of your use of the SSSCleaning.com website (“Website”
            or “Service”) and any of its related products and services
            (collectively, “Services”). This Agreement is legally binding
            between you (“User”, “you” or “your”) and SSSCleaning.com
            (“SSSCleaning.com”, “we”, “us” or “our”). If you are entering into
            this Agreement on behalf of a business or other legal entity, you
            represent that you have the authority to bind such entity to this
            Agreement, in which case the terms “User”, “you” or “your” shall
            refer to such entity. If you do not have such authority, or if you
            do not agree with the terms of this Agreement, you must not accept
            this Agreement and may not access and use the Website and Services.
            By accessing and using the Website and Services, you acknowledge
            that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by the terms
            of this Agreement. You acknowledge that this Agreement is a contract
            between you and SSSCleaning.com, even though it is electronic and is
            not physically signed by you, and it governs your use of the Website
            and Services.

        <h3>Accounts and membership</h3>

        <p>
            If you create an account on the Website, you are responsible for
            maintaining the security of your account and you are fully
            responsible for all activities that occur under the account and any
            other actions taken in connection with it. We may, but have no
            obligation to, monitor and review new accounts before you may sign
            in and start using the Services. Providing false contact information
            of any kind may result in the termination of your account. You must
            immediately notify us of any unauthorized uses of your account or
            any other breaches of security. We will not be liable for any acts
            or omissions by you, including any damages of any kind incurred as a
            result of such acts or omissions. We may suspend, disable, or delete
            your account (or any part thereof) if we determine that you have
            violated any provision of this Agreement or that your conduct or
            content would tend to damage our reputation and goodwill. If we
            delete your account for the foregoing reasons, you may not
            re-register for our Services. We may block your email address and
            Internet protocol address to prevent further registration.
        </p>

            refuse or remove any Content that, in our reasonable opinion,
            violates any of our policies or is in any way harmful or
            objectionable. Unless specifically permitted by you, your use of the
            Website and Services does not grant us the license to use,
            reproduce, adapt, modify, publish or distribute the Content created

            certain date and time when we may have backed up data for our own
